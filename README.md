## Overview

This personal package is a place to the store spatial functions and
lookups that I have created overtime and may find useful in the future,
as well as my notes on manipulating spatial objects in R.

## Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub, which also hosts the [package
site](https://gcfrench.github.io/spatialstore)

``` r
devtools::install_github("gcfrench/spatialstore")
```

## Usage

The **information section** is the place where my useful documents on
manipulating spatial objects are stored. These documents provide
information and guidance when writing spatial R scripts.

The **lookups and functions** section contain my useful spatial
functions and lookup tables. These can be used either directly by
installing and loading this package or by copying and pasting the R code
from the package’s data-raw or R sub-directories, available from the
package’s GitHub pages, into your R script. The functions contain
examples within their documentation to demonstrate their use.

The **versions** section lists the version history of this package,
along with a summary of the documents, lookups and functions added.

## Publication

The store package has been published to [GitHub
pages](https://github.com/gcfrench/spatialstore).
